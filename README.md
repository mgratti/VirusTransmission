# VirusTransmission

Simplified simulation of an epidemic in a jupyter notebook.

Developed for the Physics Praktikum, Spring Semester 2021.

The repository contains:

- the up-to-date pdf manual
- the jupyter notebook `SimpleVirusTransmissionV1.ipynb` containing the classes and the detailed tasks
- an environment file for anaconda 

Please, read carefully the manual and the indications therein, including getting acquainted with the notebook.

To run the notebook, you need recent python and numpy versions and, of course, jupyter.
If you get errors when running the notebook, I suggest to create an environment in anaconda starting from my anaconda environment: `mg_environment.yml`

Another possibility is to run the notebook on google colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com).


## Solutions

Solutions to the tasks can be found in the notebook `SimpleVirusTransmissionV1Solution.ipynb`

Error treatment for exercise 1 can be found in a separate notebook `AppendixErrorTreatment.ipynb`
